Question - You are a DevOps engineer working for a company that hosts a popular website. The website is hosted on an EC2 instance in Amazon EC2. You need to create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers an alert when the CPU usage of the EC2 instance exceeds 80% for five consecutive minutes. Write a Python script for this. 



import boto3

# Get the EC2 instance ID
instance_id = "i-0123456789abcdef0"

# Create a CloudWatch client
client = boto3.client("cloudwatch")

# Create an alarm
alarm_definition = {
    "AlarmName": "CPUUsageAlarm",
    "AlarmDescription": "Alarms when CPU usage exceeds 80% for 5 minutes",
    "MetricName": "CPUUtilization",
    "Namespace": "AWS/EC2",
    "Dimensions": [
        {
            "Name": "InstanceId",
            "Value": instance_id
        }
    ],
    "Statistic": "Average",
    "Period": 60,
    "EvaluationPeriods": 5,
    "Threshold": 80,
    "ComparisonOperator": "GreaterThanThreshold",
    "AlarmActions": [
        "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic"
    ]
}

# Create the alarm
client.put_metric_alarm(AlarmDefinition=alarm_definition)
